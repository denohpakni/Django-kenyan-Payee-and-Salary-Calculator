# Django kenyan-Payee-and-Salary-Calculator
To calculate salary and PAYEE for kenyans. Developed using django framework, JS, and HTML.

This was an interesting chalenge for me as I embark on my coding journey with Django.

The hardest part was getting the JS to work. I got some help from a friend, Moses.
The rest was easy.

In Django, I've used function based views to render the page.
And template tagging to load in the tatic fiels for the styling and JS file.

Hopefully this will help you geeks out there.

Happy learning!
