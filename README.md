# Django kenyan-Payee-and-Salary-Calculator
To calculate salary and PAYEE for kenyans. Developed using django framework, JS, and HTML.

This was an interesting chalenge for me as I embark on my coding journey with Django.

The hardest part was getting the JS to work. I got some help from a friend, Moses.
The rest was easy.

In Django, I've used function based views to render the page.
And template tagging to load in the tatic fiels for the styling and JS file.

I launched the app in heroku, which I found easier than PythonEverywhere.

Hopefully this will help you geeks out there.

Happy learning!
